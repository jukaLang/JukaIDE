## 🏃‍♀️ Running Juka IDE 🏃‍♂️

To run Juka IDE, open `index.html` on a static server. The IDE runs entirely on the client-side, providing a fast and responsive user experience. Please note that due to the constraints of the client-side web browser, many system calls may not run. However, the IDE is fully equipped to compile and run Juka code, providing real-time feedback and error messages.
